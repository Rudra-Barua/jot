## Description:
Jot is a web application that makes it convenient for users to write some notes that pertain to the content of a specific website. They can simply use this web app to open a link to website and jot down their notes. The web app also allows for users to create tasks or reminders for themselves for a specific website.
Users will also have access to these collections of notes to organize them as a single session. This is perfect for the person with hundreds of tabs open or someone who just wants to jot quick/short notes without having to tab through sites.

## Key Features:

1. Pull up the website alonside the note taking area
2. Change the website while taking notes  
3. View all the notes taken on a specific website as notebook
4. Create todo lists with tasks, specific websites, and due dates 
5. View all the todos grouped by their respective sites

## Tools:
This web application was created using Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL

5. Open the terminal and change the directory such that it is where the main project folder is
6. pip install -r requirements.txt  (On the CS50 IDE, I think I only had to get Beautiful Soup and )
